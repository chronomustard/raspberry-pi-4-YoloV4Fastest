# Human Presence Detection for Class Attendance using YoloFastestV2-ncnn

Welcome to the Human Presence Detection project designed to streamline class attendance management through computer vision techniques.

## Overview

This project is a customized adaptation of the [YoloFastestV2-ncnn repository](https://github.com/Qengineering/YoloFastestV2-ncnn) by [Qengineering](https://github.com/Qengineering), tailored specifically for detecting human presence in classroom settings. By harnessing the power of YoloFastestV2-ncnn, our focus is on providing an efficient, accurate, and real-time solution for attendance tracking.

### Features

- **Precise Human Detection:** Utilizes the YoloFastestV2-ncnn model to precisely detect and locate humans within images or live video streams.
- **Attendance Automation:** Seamlessly manages attendance records by automatically recognizing individuals present in a designated area.
- **Raspberry Pi 4 Optimization:** Optimized for deployment on Raspberry Pi 4 for efficient real-time processing.

## Getting Started
